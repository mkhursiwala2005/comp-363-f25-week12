        "A flow graph is a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ whose edges are quantified in capacity for flow. In the adjacency matrix representation, $G[i][j]$ is the capacity of the edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$. If there is no edge $i→j$, the capacity is 0 and correspondingly, $G_[i][j]=0$. A flow is anything that can be measured in time units. Bits per second in a network, cars per hour in a highway, etc. The capacity of an edge is the maximum flow that can traverse the edge.\n",

        "\n",
        "Instead of a weight, edges in flow graphs have a capacity. We write $u \\xrightarrow{10} v$ to show that the capacity of the edge from vertex $u$ to $v$ is 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "Capacities, and flows, are typically expressed in unit time such as seconds, hours, etc. For example, a road may have a capacity of 10 cars per minute, an wire has a capacity of $6.24\\times 10^8$ electrons per second, and a grocery register has a capacity of 20 clients per hour. In a flow graph, we do not show explicitly the units. We refer to the capacity just by its value, e.g., a \"capacity of 10\". The assumption is that we are in agreement of what that 10 means in the context of the graph we study (could be 10 cars a minute, 20 clients per hour, etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "When there is flow across an edge, we show its value too, with a second number: $u \\xrightarrow{5/10} v$ indicates that there is a flow of 5 (something per some unit time) across an edge that can accommodate up to 10 somethings per unit time.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we wish to be dramatic, we could write $u \\xrightarrow{0/10} v$ to emphasize that there is no flow over an edge. In desperate situations, we may even write $u \\xrightarrow{0} v$ to indicate an edge with 0 capacity; though it may be best if we just admitted there is no edge between $u$ and $v$. Algorists that write $u \\xrightarrow{0/0} v$ to indicate there is no flow over a non-existing edge, should not be allowed near computers.\n",
